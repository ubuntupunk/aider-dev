Ask Bruno is a Python script that allows you to interact with the Vectorshift AI API. It    
takes a question as input, sends it to the API, and then saves the results in a specified 
file

 4. Set your Vectorshift API key as an environment variable:                                 

export VECTORSHIFT_API_KEY=your_api_key
